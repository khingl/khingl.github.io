I study institutions and the industrial organization of science. 

My primary research fields are industrial organization and political economy where I focus on topics in science and "idea production" more broadly, often using applied microeconomics. 

My Job Market Paper is "The Prestige-Testability Tradeoff in Science." [pdf]({{ "/files/PTTS_latest.pdf" | relative_url}})
