I love sharing the economic way of thinking, and my teaching philosophy is simple: I cannot make you learn, but I can show you what it looks like to *want* to learn. 

The world is bigger and more interesting than you (and I) currently think it is, and the lens of economics lets us see it a little bit bigger and a little more interesting.
