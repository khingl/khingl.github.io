My teaching philosophy is simple: I cannot make you learn, but I can show you what it looks like to *want* to learn. 

The world is bigger and more interesting than you currently think it is, and the lens of economics lets us see it a little bit bigger and a little more interesting. Or as one great economist put it: 

*The bulk of the really important things that economics has to teach are things that people would see for themselves if they were willing to see.* ---Frank Knight (1951)
