My teaching philosophy is simple: I cannot make you learn, but I can show you what it looks like to *want* to learn. The world is bigger and more interesting than you currently think it is.

And the lens of economics letâ€™s us see it a little bit bigger and a little more interesting.


*The bulk of the really important things that economics has to teach are things that people would see for themselves if they were willing to see.* ---Frank Knight (1951)
